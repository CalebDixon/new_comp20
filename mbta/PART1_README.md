each aspect of the assignemt was implemented sucessfully. There are no bugs, however
I would have liked to have figured out a way to resize icons when the user zooms,
which I was unable to do. I did not add any of the extra features.

I spent about 5 hours on this assignement. About 2 of those were spent
on getting the map to work, another 1.5 on the marking the stations
and custom icons, and another 1.5 on the polyline. 

I did not colaborate with any other students except by reading piazza posts. I also
used the python script posted by an anonymous student to generate JSON data, which 
was a huge help (I would send that person a thank you email if I knew who it was).
